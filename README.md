## 🧩 Workflow

### 1. Prepare PCAP Files

Place your `.pcap` files in the `data/pcaps/` directory.
Each file must follow the naming convention:

```
x_y.pcap
```

Where:  
- **x** – the index of the website (e.g., its rank in the Tranco Top 1000 list)  
- **y** – the sample number for that website  

Example:  
- `5_1.pcap` → first sample of the 5th-ranked website  
- `250_3.pcap` → third sample of the 250th-ranked website  

--- 

### 2. Validate PCAPs

#### Move to the correct directory:

For ML:
```bash
cd src-ml
```
For DL:
```bash
cd src-dl
```

Then, validate the pcap files:
```bash
python 1_validate_pcaps.py
```

* Checks the integrity of PCAP files.
* Filters out corrupted or incomplete captures.

---

### 3. Extract Features

```bash
python 2_extract_features.py
```

* Converts validated PCAPs into numerical feature vectors.
* Output is a CSV (for ML) or a WANG14 format files (for DL) containing features and labels (website/component).

---

### 4. Train and Evaluate Models

#### In case of ML:
```bash
python 3_wf_attack.py
```

#### In case of DL:
:warning: Follow the instructions presented in the README.md inside the respective model to be used.
